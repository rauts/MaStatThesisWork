1. This folder contains 6 subfolders 
2. Each subfolders contains either subsubfolder or python notebooks files
3. Notebooks are run by using %run magic command where files are referenced using relative
paths. It may be possible to change relative paths commands for other operating systems as these files are created in Windows 10.

Usage and Caution:

1. The first notebook file to be run is 'InitializationOfFunctions.ipynb' which is in the folder 'PythonNotebook_InitializationOfFunction'. But this file has to be run by another notebook in the location of two level inside in the directory hierarchy for successful operations otherwise errors may occur. After running this file, all the user defined functions will be available for use in the further setps or analysis. 

2. Always run this file before doing anything, i.,e., if you change a function or create a new function always save the updated notebook files and then run 'InitializationOfFunctions.ipynb' file in order to see the effect of changes made recently.
